Generic description of the classes of the program:


- Particle is the core visual-object class, from which a great number of different classes can be inherited (particles, stars, bubbles, squares...).

- Scene includes an array of particles and manages their update and drawing on screen.

- Stage includes an array of scenes and manages the passage from one scene to another.
